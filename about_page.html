					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						Hello, my name is Tania. I am a 30 year old mother of one. I currently work for a telecommunications company where I am following a program to earn a degree in Human Resources which is one of my passions. I love to help people out whenever they have any questions or feel like they are stuck and need advice or simple just need to talk things out to someone in full confidence.
There are many things I like to do but some of my passions are gymming, finding and listening to new music, and spending time with my family, specifically my daughter. I have accomplished many things in my life but I am always trying to better myself, but not only for myself but also my daughter. My daughter is my main motivator to always try my best to improve myself, but other than her I am self-driven to better myself because no one in my family has been able to accomplish many of the things I have although I am a single mother.
Many things I have accomplished include Graduating from college with a Bachelors in Science, bought my first home at a really young age, was promoted quickly in my current workplace by exceeding expectations and proving myself capable of handling my current role. One goal I have currently set for myself this year is either to grow in my company or to develop myself into a role in Human Resources because I feel I can make a real difference in that role because I am naturally good when it comes to this.
